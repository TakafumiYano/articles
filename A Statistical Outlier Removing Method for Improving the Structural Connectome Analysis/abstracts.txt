In recent years, the probabilistic tractography has been widely applied to connectome-based diffusion tractography studies, and high-quality fiber tracking plays a critical role in this study. Unfortunately, because of the nature of probabilistic tractography, many spurious outlier fibers are generated, that outlier fibers traverse looped pathways or too long pathways. In this study, we demonstrate the outlier fibers generated by the probabilistic tractography could not be removed with the conventional length-bases removing method. Then, we propose the novel method to remove outlier fibers without heuristic adjusting to each network. In this method, fibers are characterized by the three-dimensional feature vector (length, mean-density, mean-curvature) to obtain more effective features than the fiber length. To obtain the mean-density and mean-curvature along fibers, the track weighted density and track curvature image are obtained, and the mean-density and the mean-curvature along the fibers are calculated by averaging of the density and the curvature of all voxels where the fibers crossed, respectively. These features are statistically tested by robust Mahalanobis distance with the threshold as 4. This proposed filtering algorithm could remove most of the spurious fibers without heuristic criterion and any manual proce- dure. We applied this filter into a data set of a healthy subject from human connectome project database (n=11).We compared the non-filtered connectome matrices and the con- nectomes with this outlier removing, and we found that results, the number of fibers in each subject reduced by the average of 7.7%, and we visually inspected the result.We demon- strated that the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed method in particular structural connectome based diffusion MRI studies.
