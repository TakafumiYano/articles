In recent years, the probabilistic tractography has been widely applied to connectome-based diffusion tractography studies, and high-quality fiber tracking plays a critical role in this study. Unfortunately, because of the nature of probabilistic tractography, many spurious outlier fibers are generated, that outlier fibers traverse looped pathways or too long pathways. In this study, we demonstrate the outlier fibers generated by the probabilistic tractography could not be removed with the conventional length-bases removing method. Then, we propose the novel method to remove outlier fibers without heuristic adjusting to each network. In this method, fibers are characterized by the three-dimensional feature vectors (length, mean-density, mean-curvature) to obtain more effective features than the fiber length. The features are statistically tested by robust Mahalanobis distance with a certain threshold. This proposed algorithm could remove most of the outlier fibers without any heuristic manual procedure. We applied this filter to healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project (n=11). We compared the non-filtered connectome matrices and the connectomes with this outlier removing, and we found that the number of fibers in each subject reduced by the average of 9%. 
We addressed that the effectiveness of this result in structural connectome studies.
